### A Pokemon Guessing Game
Guess the Pokemon, A fun project for me to learn about getting images from a website and showing it to the user. It's a guessing game that let user guess the name of a random pokemon shown on the screen. With this program I learned to create a GUI specifically canvas in Tkinter for easy use and play. I also added a hint function that if the user is stuck, they can use hint to move to the next pokemon.

### Demo

### Requirements and Usage
Clone/Download this repo 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/gnat10/guess_the_pokemon.git
```
check `requirements.txt` or:
```shell
requests
random
os
tkinter
pillow
```
Go to the root dir and create a virtual env with the **requirements.txt** file.
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
Run the script
```bash
python main.py
```
This will run the program!

### What's Next
I'd like to have a highscore tracker as well as making so that the user have limited lives to guess. It will be great to have the pokemon sprites turned into silhouettes first and reveal it after guessing correctly like in the anime. I also would like to add options to choose which gen the pokemon that we can guess.
